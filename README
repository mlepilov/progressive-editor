Progressive Editor
----
Progressive Editor is a rudimentary start to a StarCraft scenario ("map")
editor, written in C++ using nothing but the Win32 API. So far, it supports
reading and writing both raw .chk and compressed .scm/.scx scenarios, and it
implements a map class featuring individual classes for every data chunk
present in the scenario, ready to be used to edit the map. The editor was
written with speed and support for reading corrupted maps; the beginnings of a
"map repair" function can be seen.

It currently uses a 3rd-party library to hook into Storm.dll (the library
shipped with StarCraft and other Blizzard Entertainment games to unarchive
their proprietary .mpq/.scm/.scx format); this provides the best way to read
corrupted maps.

This project was written long ago and subsequently abandoned by me, but others
interested in making a map editor could easily use the parts on this repo to
quickly start making either a map editor, or a map editing library. I last
compiled/debugged it in 2007 using Visual Studio 6.0 (old school), and I last
ran it on Windows XP. It might compile and run successfully on more current
versions of Windows/Visual Studio, but the new memory protection features of
Windows Vista/7 might make the 3rd-party Storm.dll-hooking library
non-functional. In that case, there is another 3rd-party .mpq library on this
repo, called lmpqapi, that is actually documented and allows .mpq/.scm/.scx
unarchiving. I might also be using a few deprecated features of the Win32 API,
but I don't think that's likely.
